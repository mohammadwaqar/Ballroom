                        <p>
                            The 50% deposit goes towards your rental and is non-refundable, with no exceptions.  The remaining balance is due on or before 14 days prior to your event date. If unpaid, the card on file will be charged on the 13th day prior to your event date.

Ballroom Surge has the right to cancel your event for non-payment 13 days prior to your event date for an unpaid balance.

                            There is a $200 Security Deposit held <span>two days prior</span> to your booking date as a separate transaction than the booking amount, with more details outlined below. The $150 cleaning fee charged at time of booking includes removal of trash bags, breaking down of tables and chairs, and cleaning of restrooms and contact surfaces.  Additional charges may be taken from the security deposit if violations are made through the Security Deposit Agreement signed separately.  The Security Deposit Agreement is attached to your invoice under “View Required Documents”. Ballroom Surge reserves the right to cancel a rental if the Security Deposit Agreement is not signed. The Security Deposit covers damage, missing items, additional/professional cleaning, or other violations outlined in the <span>Security Deposit Agreement.</span>

                            The Security Deposit payment is held pending until we return to the space to check for cleanliness, damage, missing items, indoor smoking, etc. We use the card on file given for your Security Deposit hold, you do not have to do anything further. This transaction is made via Stripe using Authorize and Capture. We do not charge the card (capture the charge), you will see it pending and will not process unless we find a reason to need to create a true charge. If we find reason to charge your security deposit amount, we will contact you prior to making the charge to discuss. We have up to 7 days to capture a charge from the date of your rental. It is our policy to contact you right away. The hold is released when we find no reason to charge your security deposit.  Ballroom Surge has the right to capture the initial $200 Security Deposit hold and any other amount to cover damages with the card on file if there are obvious damages beyond $200 when we enter the space.

                        <h3> DEPOSIT AND CANCELLATION CHARGES </h3>
                        <p>The half-down payment is non-refundable. An event is considered booked when Ballroom Surge has received 50% of the rental amount and Ballroom Surge confirms the booking as reserved via email. The half-down deposit will be applied to the total balance. The remaining balance must be paid on or before 14 days prior to the rental date and is non-refundable/non-transferable. Should the event be canceled or postponed, the half-down amount paid is non-refundable, no exceptions. If a rental is canceled at least 30 days prior to the rental date, the half-down amount, and any additional amount paid, can be applied toward another event with Ballroom Surge or anything paid over the half-down deposit can be refunded. Cancellations/transfers must be used no later than 12 (twelve) months after the original scheduled rental date. We allow one date transfer per rental.  Transferred rentals are subject to current pricing, so original rental price will not be honored for the transferred date. For date transfers: the full balance will be due at the time of booking to reserve your new date. The total amount paid will be non-refundable and non-transferable.  Ballroom Surge has the right to send your balance owed to collections for non-payment.  Ballroom Surge does not provide refunds for situations beyond our control such as but not limited to weather or shutdowns issued by the nation/city/state.  Ballroom Surge does not give refunds for rentals booked prior to touring to secure a date yet later decide the venue is not a good fit. </p>
                        <p> Renter shall not hold Ballroom Surge liable for any Covid-19 related issues.</p>
                        <p>Ballroom Surge reserves the right to cancel your Event at any time and is not required to credit or refund you for any amount paid if your event is cancelled for not following Ballroom Surge guidelines.</p>
